Introduction:

The purpose of this work was to develop a fully connected artificial neural network to disagregate e individualize each electrical appliance consumption in a residence, only through information acquired by a central energy meter, thus providing important data that can be used, by energy dealers and also customers, to identify consumption patterns and potential energy savings. The case study was conducted on three electrical appliances with data available on public dataset REDD, which has energy consumption data for several appliances, logged during days of measuring on six diferente houses. The obtained results while testing the trained models were satisfactory, with some cases reaching up to 97% accuracy.

By no means it was intended to reach state-of-the-art results, but to truly ilustrate and study the capabilities of A.I. in desagregation by proposing and creating an artificial neural network, and to show that A.I. can be used in many different applications, including applications in the energy sector.

Usage:

Clone the repo and put the REDD 'low_freq' folder inside
